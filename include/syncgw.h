/**

	Title:			Enable CLPBOARD as clipboard device
	
	Description: 	Enable read/write access to Windows Clipboard. This patch has some limitations:

					1. Works only on Windows host operating systems
    				2. Supports only text read/write to/from clip board

	Testing:		1. Start notepad.exe in Win
					2. open DosBox
    				3. enter "copy z:\autoexec.bat clpboard"
    				3. switch to notepad and enter <CTRL><V>
    				4. you should see content of autoexec.bat
    				5. modify content and mark block; enter <CTRL><C>
    				6. switch to DosBox and enter "copy clpboard con"
    				7. You should see modified data

	Change log:		2007-06-10 - Created
					2007-07-27 - Modified code to support unlimited clipboard access (formerly limited to 32767 bytes)

/**

	Title:			Printer device LPT1-4 support

	Description: 	Printer output for LPT1-4 is captures and written into a file "devLPTx.prn" (x-device 1-4) in the 
					DoxBox directory. If print is terminated (DOS program closes the device) a system command (defined 
					in dosbox.conf) is executed to deliver output to host printing system. All output from the issued 
					command is echoed to the DosBox console. At termination of DosBox, the temporary "device" files 
					will be automatically deleted.

	Configuration:	1. Compile the DosBox SYNCGW Edition
					2. Call dosbox.exe
    				3. Enter "config -writeconf dosbox.conf"
    				4. Load dosbox.conf into editor
    				5. Search for "[printer]" section
    				6. Print output is discarded by default:
		
						...
        				LPT1=disable
        				...

    				7. Change "disable" to a command which sends output file to your host printing system. If you're 
					   working on a Windows system, you may use "copy %s LPT1 >Nul". "%s" is replaced at runtime with 
					   the full path name to the directory where DosBox.Exe is located.
    				8. Review parameter "printer_timeout". It specifies how long print output will be "spooled" before 
					   output is delivered to host printing system (1000 ticks is approx. 1 second).

	Some hints:		- The ">Nul" parameter is used to minimize output to DosBox console (error message will still be 
					  shown on DosBox console window). Check out as required. For debugging purposes you may discard 
					  that parameter. 
					- You may use more complex commands. If the DOS program generated PostScript output and you've 
					  only a PCL printer, then you can convert the print output by sending print file to GhostScript 
					  (which is able to convert output from PostScript to PCL) and then send it to your printer.
					- You can easily redirect output from one printer device to a different host system printer device 
					  by modifying the output command (e.g. "LPT2=copy %s LPT1 >Nul").

	Testing:		1. Specify "LPT1=type %s" in dosbox.conf
    				2. Open DosBox
					3. Enter "copy z:\autoexec.bat LPT2"
					4. A message should appear in console window notifying output is discarded
    				5. Enter "copy z:\autoexec.bat LPT1"
    				6. Content of file should be shown in console window

/**

	Title:			Enable Special German characters ("Umlaute") in file names

	Description: 	In the good old days of DOS, characters were encoded in one byte (8 bits). At the beginning, 
					a 7-bit character set was defined. This was enough for all English users :roll:. As DOS was 
					spread over the world, requirements for internationalization raised. As you can imagine, the 
					remaining 128 characters available in a byte were far not enough to provide all characters 
					needed in all countries. To provide localization the extended ASCII char set (consisting of 
					256 different characters) was born, but never standardized. The "new" 128 characters were 
					filled up depending on the code pages used (For a detailed discussion about code page see 
					http://www.freedos.org/freedos/news/technote/141.txt).

					Those code page has basically nothing to do with DOS file names. File names (and directory 
					names as well) are restricted. Legal characters for DOS file names include the following:

    				Upper case letters A-Z
    				Numbers 0-9				
    				Space (though trailing spaces are considered to be padding and not a part of the file name)
    				! # $ % & ( ) - @ ^ _ ` { } ~ '
    				Values 128-255

					Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table

					MS-DOS (which is only one out of a couple of DOS provided by MicroSoft) makes more restrictions. 
					It does not allow the character values 128-255. 
					(see: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q120138)

					DOSBox itself supports the MS-DOS approach. If you've ever used a different DOS then you probably 
					need more characters.

					Another problem arises when trying to create files in the host environment (in my case Windows 
					XP). Due to the fact that the extended ASCII character set was not properly adapted to the ANSI 
					code used in Windows XP, the German characters has different code page positions. You may notice 
					this, if you open a DOS text file and the special characters looks very strange.

					To circumvent this situation are mapping is done by this patch. If you create a file named "���" 
					it would also appear as "���" in your Windows XP operating system.

					Please keep in mind, this patch takes care only about the translation of "Umlaute" characters to 
					the Windows XP file system.

	Testing:		1. Enter "copy Z:\autoexec.bat c:\�������"
    				2. Enter "dir c:\�������"

/**

	Title:			Add "Set file date and time" interrupt
